# hello-world
Test

I want to learn programming. I have always had an interest. I went to college to learn but I didn't focus and study and I feel like I have already wasted so much time and opportunities. That's why I'm here. I want to work and study hard to make something of myself. I want to be proud of who I am and what I do.
